CSS styles for MyAnimeList by Valkyrio100

This is a repository for CSS custom styles for MAL made or edited by me. 
Some of them will be inspired on other styles that I have modified to give them a unique look. The authors of the original styles
are credited on each CSS.

Small guide on how to install them:
  1. Download the background and the cover image 
  2. Go to Account Settings -> List Style Design
  3. Use the modern default theme for the list you want to edit and click on the image 
  4. Upload the background and the cover image
  5. Go to Add Custom CSS and paste the CSS file content there
  6. Press Save

If you notice something broken or unmodified dont doubt to contact me this way.
If you want to make some small changes look into the CSS that ~~should~~ will be properly documented
